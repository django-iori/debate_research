They said that if a form of punishment motivates crime, it no longer functions as a punishment, so the death penalty should be abolished since some criminals are motivated to end their lives. However, it is much more likely that someone would commit a crime in order to be imprisoned, rather than put to death. The phenomenon of institutionalization explains why some people would prefer to spend their lives behind bars, in a system where they are fed and clothed and tended to, free from having to think and act independently. By recommending life sentences rather than death sentences, we are possibly motivating persons who have become institutionalized and feel they cannot function outside of prison walls to commit heinous crimes. In contrast, it makes no sense to commit such a crime with the ultimate goal of getting put to death because this sentence is so rarely carried out. If "suicide by the state" is desired, all that is needed is to get in a standoff with armed police, after all.
