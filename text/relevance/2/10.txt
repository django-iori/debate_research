They said that homework makes the gap between children  who have support from parents and those who do not have. However,  this is not true. This is because teachers give children homework which matches children’s levels. Moreover students have already learned the contents of homework in classes. So in many cases  you can do homework without parent’s help. Even if it is difficult for students to do homework alone and you can not help your parents, you can ask teachers or study and check up with textbooks. Therefore, it is not true.
