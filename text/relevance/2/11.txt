They said that school should teach academic skills within class time, so homework should be abolished. However, if we abolish homework and schools only teach in class, the quality of teaching and the rate of acquisition of skills are decreased. It is because schools check the skills of students through homework, feedback to students, and change the content of class suited to students’ acquisitions. Therefore, homework is extremely important to create classes. If homework is disappeared, school cannot grasp students’ abilities and simply speaking about textbook. Therefore, homework is a significant tool to communicate teachers with students. Therefore, school should not act only within classes.
