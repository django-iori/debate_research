They said that due to homework, relationship between children and parents becomes worse. However, it will rather become worse under their side. Because under their side, parents will have to tell children to study more because criteria of whether children study or not is quite unclear. On our side, doing homework is a proof that children finish certain amount of studing, but without homework, parents can’t know to what extent children have to study due to lack of the some measureable criteria. That’ why parental intervantion will bacome more stronger because parents want to avoid the situation where children lack the enough amount of studying.
