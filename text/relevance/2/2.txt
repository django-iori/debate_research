They said that prison guards who take part in executions suffer, so the death penalty needs to be abolished. However, why do we need prison guards to carry out executions? If their suffering is the issue, then why not make this a volunteer position? In addition to crime victims and their loved ones, there are probably a lot of people who would feel no guilt about serving as executioner in a case where the accused committed a horrific crime and was found guilty by his peers. In fact, a lottery might have to be held to award the executioner role, due to the vast number of applicants for the task. Maybe it would be better to let ordinary citizens instead of prison workers do this job anyway, in the same way we let ordinary citizens sit on the juries that decide the fate of prisoners, including life or death sentences.
