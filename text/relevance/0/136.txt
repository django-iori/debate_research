They said that life imprisonment is a better option than the death penalty, which solves nothing. However, one problem that life imprisonment exacerbates and the death penalty solves is prison overcrowding. By freeing up prison space, prisoners are spared some of the attending problems of overcrowding, such as increased fighting and lack of oversight and a shortage of space for recreation. We often hear complaints about the inhumane circumstances prisoners are kept in. Yet, a life sentence would only extend the prisoner's time spent in those inhumane circumstances, instead of being an opportunity for real transformation. Being in prison for a long time tends to create hardened prisoners who can no longer function in society because they have become adapted to a life behind bars. Thus, life imprisonment represents the opposite of rehabilitation.
