They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character because they are always being looked after by their teacher. However, there are two rebuttals. First, it is not true because we can manage ourselves even if there are homework. If they think about their academic ability seriously, they can do everything for example read another books, go to cram schools and so on. Therefore homework is not the obstruction of their independence. Second, that is not mutually exclusive. There are no proof that all students will think about themselves seriously. And I think students won't think because most of them think that "I don't have to study." Students are immature, so they will abandon study. Therefore, there are no connection between taking this motion and students  independence. And there are no contradiction because first I said about serious students. And second, I said about most of students. Even if some students can think seriously, there are no relationship between homework. As a result, both side their argument is not standing.
