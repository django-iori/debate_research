They said that homework doesn't teach how to live. However, when it comes to learning real life skills, homework probably does a better job than in-class studying. For instance, homework today often involves the very real life skill of Googling, specifically, and learning how and where to find valid resources, generally. Resourcefulness is a key life skill that homework fosters. Because homework isn't done with teacher supervision, it requires students to follow basic directions and then troubleshoot solutions to difficulties encountered along the way. Moreover, because homework is done independently by students, it helps develop traits of resilience, creativity, critical thinking, and work ethic. Thus, homework helps students learn how to live in a world that is much bigger than the classroom and one that is filled with more and different challenges.
