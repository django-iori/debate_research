They said that carrying out the death penalty causes the executioner to suffer, so it should be abolished. However, if it were true that executioners suffer terribly because of their part in capital punishment, wouldn't we hear about a dire shortage of these workers? Being an executioner is part of a prison job, which is a voluntary position, meaning the person had to seek out the job. No one is being forced against their will to carry out a legal execution. So, the assumption of suffering and stress on the part of the executioner is unproven and probably exaggerated. For all we know, executioners feel relief and pride instead of stress when they perform a job intended to keep society safe and bring justice to victims. Thus, this argument is too weak to stand.
