They said that there is always a risk of mistake, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, instead of eliminating a punishment that is supported by the Constitution and meant to protect society, we should strive to reduce the chance of error and ensure that mistakes are corrected. In fact, we are already making strides on both fronts. Technology in the form of nearly foolproof DNA and security camera footage means we don't have to depend on error-prone confessions, eyewitness accounts and jailhouse "snitches". Media focus on capital punishment cases and organizations dedicated to preventing wrongful executions serve as a check on issues such as prosecutorial and jury misconduct. Meanwhile, systems are in place to allow correction of trial mistakes, particularly the appeals process that every death row prisoner can utilize.
