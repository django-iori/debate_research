They said that death penalty should be abolished. However, if someone is spending life in prison, why should we worry about their rehabilitation? They are never going to be a member of society again. If they are still the sick murderers that they were to get them on death row, so be it. They are locked up where they belong. They should not be getting any sort of care with our hard earned tax payer money. Let’s keep the death penalty and get rid of these criminals as soon as possible. The rehab of their mental state should be the last thing we worry about. They don’t deserve that chance.
