They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character. However, I believe that homework should not be abolished from schools. I believe that if the homework is assigned correctly and the student understands how to complete it well it will not make the student passive. Rather, it will encourage the student to find and use outside resources in order to enlargen their educational sphere. If the student doesn't know how to do something or how to answer a question the student will have to find appropriate resources to find out how and the student will additionally have to understand how to use those resources. This is something that employers generally do like because it shows that the worker knows how to be independent and work on their own rather than relying on their supervisor for assistance as soon as any sort of challenge arises.
