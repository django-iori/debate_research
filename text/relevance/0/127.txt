They said that rehabilitation, not execution, is the responsible option for those who commit the most serious crimes. However, like it or not, prisons have to operate within a budget. Taxpayers already complain about the high cost of keeping criminals behind bars. Thus, we need to prioritize where to invest taxpayer dollars in the criminal justice system to get the best return on our investment. Investing in costly rehab programs for the worst violent offenders who are supposed to be serving life terms seems foolhardy. Wouldn't it make more sense to spend that money on trying to rehabilitate first offenders and non-violent criminals, so they can succeed outside prison and have no desire or need to ever return to a life of crime? After all, these more minor offenders actually do have a chance of becoming contributing members of society and even taxpayers themselves.
