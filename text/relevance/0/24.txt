They said that death penalty should be abolished because it's inhumane punishment. However, I don't feel that death penalty should be abolished. I am sure that the judge wouldn't have given this punishment unless they believed that the criminal deserves it. Is it inhumane? First please look at the crime they committed. If the perpetrator's crime involved extreme violence on their victim, I feel that the death penalty is justified. Besides, it's not necessarily inhumane punishment. If the criminal gets a life imprisonment without parole, there is nothing for the criminal to look forward to. Life in prison is not pleasant and is more inhumane than death penalty. Therefore I don't feel that death penalty should be abolished.
