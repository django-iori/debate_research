They said that the death penalty is a cruel penalty. However, the death penalty is a cruel penalty is a fact. But it is not a know fact to criminals. No criminal will apologize to the law saying that he don't know the punishment he is going to get if he do a crime. If a criminal uses such excuse then he must be a mental disability person or he must be under age group of 18 or may be an immatured person. In such case the punishment must be decided after thinking more .
