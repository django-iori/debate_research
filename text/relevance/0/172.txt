They said that unlike rehabilitation, the death penalty solves nothing, so it should be abolished. However, compared with any other type of sentencing, the death penalty offers a permanent, long-term solution instead of a short-term fix or a gamble on rehabilitation. You can argue that the death penalty is cruel, that it is meted out unfairly, and any number of other arguments, but you can't claim that it doesn't solve the issue of repeat offenders with 100 percent effectiveness. When a death row prisoner is executed, there is no chance of recidivism. Perhaps even more importantly, there is absolute closure -- or as close to absolute closure as we can get -- for the crime victim and their loved ones. Thus, it is completely untrue that the death penalty isn't an effective and practically foolproof solution to a real problem.
