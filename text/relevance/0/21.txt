They said that there is a risk of innocent people being executed, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, it is a myth that death row is filled with truly innocent individuals. The majority of death sentences end up being reduced on appeal. However, that certainly doesn't mean that the majority of those sentenced to death were innocent. Typically, sentences are reduced due to legal technicalities and due to issues unrelated to innocence such as jury tampering and prosecutorial misconduct. While death row cases do in fact account for a preponderance of exonerations, this doesn't mean each exonerated party was actually innocent. An exoneration might indicate a lack of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, for instance. Hence, it can't be argued that the danger of executing innocents is a valid reason to ban the death penalty.
