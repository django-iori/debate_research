They said that some students can't get parental support. It's unfair. However, it's not true. This unfairness doesn't matter. Because even if some parents are busy and can't help their children, but still children can ask their teachers some questions. Also, this opportunity is equally accessible for every students. They can ask teachers after the homeroom or classes. Also, teachers will answer the questions kindly because they have incentive to do so. So, there is no unfairness during the process of doing homework.
