They said that human life is too precious to allow the state to impose the death penalty. However, it is because human life is so precious that we must have the most severe punishment as an option for those who commit murder. If the death penalty prevents the murder of innocents by serving as a deterrent, it is warranted. Moreover, we know that released criminals sometimes go on to commit further crimes, including murder. This possibility is erased when the criminal is put to death. Even a life sentence doesn't provide 100 percent protection against the chance of a prisoner killing again, since his victims can be found within the prison walls in the form of a fellow inmate or a prison guard. There is always the slim chance of escape from prison, too. Thus, the death penalty helps protect precious lives -- lives arguably more precious than that of the person who committed the crime worthy of death.
