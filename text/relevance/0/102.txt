They said that because of the chance of mistaken judgment, the death penalty should be abolished. However, reducing the chances of mistakes of judgment in capital punishment should then be the goal. Instead of abandoning the death penalty, which is an effective tool of the criminal justice system, we should work to lower the incidence of mistaken judgment in such cases. One way to do this is to raise the bar for cases deemed suitable to warrant the death penalty. Another way is to increase the burden of proof needed for a conviction in a capital punishment case. Expanding the number of jurors and insisting on a unanimous juror verdict in death penalty case would also lower the odds of misjudgment. Likewise, juries should be better educated about applying the death penalty, and they should be protected from retribution and prohibited from profiting from their participation -- ensuring that jurors vote based on evidence only.
