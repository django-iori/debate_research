They said that rehabilitation, not the death penalty, should be the focus of how we deal with serious crime. However, rehabilitation is just one of the goals of the criminal justice system. It is a mistake to put all the focus on this one goal, while ignoring the others. A prison sentence is also supposed to serve as a deterrent, meaning that the sentence is unpleasant enough to make would-be criminals think twice about taking the risk. Prison is intended as punishment, vengeance, or retribution too; we expect criminals to pay society back for their wrongdoings, and taking away their freedom is one way to exact punishment. Incarceration is also a way to incapacitate those who commit crimes. The death penalty happens to be very effective at achieving all of these objectives, with the exception of rehabilitation. However, a life sentence is also a poor way to achieve this last goal since the inmate isn't expected to reenter society.
