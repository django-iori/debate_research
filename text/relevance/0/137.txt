They said that “Brutalization of the society.”. However, though modern society is becoming more and more brutal and there are a lots of examples in the news media. But my point is now a days these cases are more disclosed and published in the media than before. Again "Death penalty" can not be kept on the same plane of 'Brutalization'. If one or both of the kidneys are damaged peoples are required to operate and cut off and replace the kidneys. Some times any human body part becomes infected by 'Cancer' and to save human life it is necessary to cut off that very part. These is very incidents known to all in our society and these can not be called as 'Brutalization'. When some people acts like 'Cancer' or the society considers one as a 'Cancer' to society it is necessary to cut off the part. So Death Penalty should not be abolished.
