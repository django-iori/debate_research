They said that we can get free time. However, it is not true. This is because students will not be able to figure out which areas they are having trouble with at the moment. Because if they have free time, it would be very difficult to keep track of everything. For example, if one of student have a math problem. And teacher will be understand about this problem. However, if free time will be accepte, student continue to this problem. Finally we can't solving this problem. On this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.
