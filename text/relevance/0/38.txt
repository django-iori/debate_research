They said that studying should not be obligated by teachers and parents. They said an example of a baby. However,  it is not true. This is because babies are also obligated to do many things by parents . For example parents force babies to remember a lot of words, walk alone, eat like or dislike and so on. This is because babies do not know what is good or bad. Therefore parents support by forcing. As same as children also do not know what is useful in the future. So in order to get new things, children should be obligated by parents or teacher.
