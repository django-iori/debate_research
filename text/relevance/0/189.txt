They said that prisoner rehabilitation is the responsibility of the nation. However, if we are going to be serious about rehabilitation, we have to be willing to invest significant resources into these programs. And, if the goal of rehabilitation is reintegration of the prisoner into society, we have to continue to invest once the convict is released. In order to fund these expensive programs, we have to convince taxpayers that spending even more of their tax dollars on criminals is worthwhile and that it is actually their responsibility. Then, we have to change society's attitude about criminals so that communities embrace ex-convicts rather than ostracizing them. And we can't neglect the job of fixing societal problems that contribute to the risk of criminal behavior. These are all lofty goals, but there is no explanation of how any of this can be accomplished.
