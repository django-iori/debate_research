They said that homework doesn't fit into the student's busy schedule. However, in life, it is important to learn how to prioritize activities. Having a busy schedule is a fact of life for students, and being too busy to fit in every possible activity is something that continues into adulthood. That's why it's so important to figure out how to decide which activities matter most and deserve priority over less meaningful activities. It's pretty easy to see that homework is more important than playing video games or hanging out with friends at the mall, for instance, since homework is part of education. Thus, the student should put "doing my homework" at or near the top of the list when deciding how to allocate limited time.
