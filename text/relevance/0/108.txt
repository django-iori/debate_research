They said that we believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. However, I think homework is very important to the development and growth of children. The most important characteristic of homework is that it reinforces what was learned that day at school. Instead of allowing lessons to be quickly forgotten and left behind it encourages the student to practice those same lessons until the student is at a point where the student feels confident with it. Homework also encourages responsibility because the student has to take responsibility for completing the homework on time and turning it in. If this is not done it will result in a lowering of the student's grade which teaches responsibility. Additionally homework teaches students how to set schedules and prioritize. The student will have to be able to work their assigned homework into available time that may be partially occupied by extra curricular activities. This helps the student to learn to decide what's most important.
