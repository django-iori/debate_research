However, government side hasnâ€™t explained how to teach students the way to properly study without any homework, or how to encourage students who have memorized the incorrect way to accomplish a correct way, thus even if we abolish homework, there is no guarantee that students will have proper way to study or reform their incorrect way to study. Therefore, what Prime Minister said is not the effective reason to abolish homework.
