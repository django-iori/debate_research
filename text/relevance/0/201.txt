They said that that homework is useless and should be taken away from being done. However, well first off, homework is what makes school school really. I think there are a lot of good things that can come from homework. I think one thing that people do not talk about with homework is that it makes kids more disciplined and is good for the soul. It gets kids working harder at a younger age and being more focused at an early age which could lead to better things down the road as an adult as well.
