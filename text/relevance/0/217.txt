They said that all instruction is the responsibility of the school system. However, it is unfair and wrong to play the onus of teaching children solely on the shoulders of the school system. Parents should be responsible for teaching their children. To say that "all necessary and important lessons" must be learned from school is preposterous at best. Parents teach lessons about real world situations and responsibilities such as money management, cooking, self-care, and the proper way to handle oneself in society. Parents must share in the responsibility for teaching these real world skills along with knowledge. If there is no reinforcement of learning at home and when interacting with the world at large, the learning at school become isolated and meaningless. By integrating homework into a child's learning experience, schools help bridge the gap between the two environments.
