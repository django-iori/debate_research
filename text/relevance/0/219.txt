They said that some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. However, it's not important. This is because that is not a mutually exclusive point. In the first place, those students tend not to feel guilty to break the rule which is shown by their teachers. That is unfortunately obvious when we see their actions concerned with homework. They can commit such a bad way to do homework precisely because they don't think the rule of their school is so important. So we think that even if homework were abolished, for example, they will commit that during tests. That's the reason why their analysis is not so mutually exclusive.
