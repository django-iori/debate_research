They said that constant exposure to violent news media is causing society to become more brutal and violent. However, this argument about the news causing individuals to become more and more violent is false. One major counter argument would be the fact that violence existed among humans even before the invention of things like electronics. We have written documentation of things like crucifixion in the Bible and that is far more violent and upsetting than things we see on the news. If anything, past generations were even more violent and killed for things far more serious like religion.
