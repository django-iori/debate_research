They said that this is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. However, it is ridiculous to hear a argument that "This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely.

Whether it is family  or a community or a city or country there must be some rules and regulations that must be followed by all. If not it will lead only to crimes thinking that no one should ask other.
