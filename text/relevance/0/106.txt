They said that inhumane punishment. However, some says that Death penalty is a inhumane punishment. In my view it a punishment to human who behaves in an inhumane manner. They must deserve it to know what is the pain if he behave inhumanly. They must not get excuses by abolishing the death penalty. Even if there comes a law they must be punished in a severe manner that they must always have some pain to make them feel.
