They said that executioners feel a sense of responsibility or blame, so the death penalty should be abolished to spare them. However, while it is understandable that participating in an execution could lead to feelings of guilt, the executioner actually holds no blame. The solution is to educate would-be executioners so they understand their small but vital role in the criminal justice system. Executioners should be educated on all the steps in the legal process, understanding the weight of evidence against the accused, and the roles played by the judge and jury in the case -- who bear much more responsibility for the judgment of death. By letting would-be executioners see that the justice system is fair and that only those with undeniable evidence against them receive this sentence, they will understand who bears the real guilt in death penalty cases.
