They said that we can get free time. However, it is not true. Because, It could be biased towards any one thing. This is because while the free time provides more options for a variety of options, it may also bias the ability to do so and affect learning. For example, if some students taking part of playing baseball. However, this student is concentrate only baseball. So after that, student study score is getting down. From this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.
