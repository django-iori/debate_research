They said that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. In other words, we can not do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends because of a lot of homework. However, i think that we have enough time for doing more of what we really like. We can play with friends and devote oneself to club activities and hobbies on weekend like Saturday and Sunday. If we don't have enough time on weekend, we should consider our ways to spend time. In this case, we don't have enough time on weekday. So, we have to consider our ways to spend time more effectively.
