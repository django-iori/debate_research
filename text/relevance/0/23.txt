They said that if homework were to be abolished, we can enjoy more free time. However, it's not true. Because instead of doing homework, we have to take time to catch up with classes. Please recognize purpose of homework. Homework exists to facilitate our efficient review and preparation for classes such as practice of using some formulas, or writing kanji. That's why even without homework, we have to study by ourselves anyway to understand classes. But problem is; we will take time to decide contents and review knowledge. Because we don't know what we should do. Given that, we can't have more free time on Gov side and homework rather allow we to study efficiently and have more free time.
