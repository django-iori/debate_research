They said that elementary school students should learn all they need to know to function in society at school and that homework should not be mandatory because some children do not have two parents or parents who are willing or able to help them with it. However, in order for students to really grasp what is being taught to them in schools, homework is a necessity. People of all ages tend to forget things they learn right after they learn them. If children aren't made to go home and use what they learned to complete the homework, they won't be able to remember as much, which would make the work at school useless. Completing more work at home helps to ensure that what they learned will stay in their heads and not just be instantly forgotten. Sure, there is going to be a gap between kids who have helpful parents and kids who do not, but that's a fact of life for everything, not just homework. This doesn't mean homework is not helpful or should be abolished.
