They said that the death penalty is wrong because it involves one person killing another. However, there is a fundamental difference between the executioner and the condemned criminal. The executioner is lawfully carrying out a sentence decided by a unanimous jury in a court of law, while the condemned criminal unlawfully carried out an act deemed a capital offense. In this instance, the two acts of killing cannot be judged the same. The killing of the criminal is an act of justice and is therefore right instead of wrong. You might say that two "wrongs" -- that is, killings -- make a "right" in the case of putting to death a guilty criminal who has caused the deaths of innocents.
