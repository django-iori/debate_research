They said that we should abolish the death penalty because it's a burden on the executioner. However, most jobs come with burdens, some heavier than others. However, jobs with the heaviest burdens are also often the most important. For instance, throughout our history we have used soldiers to fight for our country, and some of those soldiers had to kill as part of their job. Yet, we venerate soldiers and their sacrifice. Instead of deciding that fighting for our country isn't a valid cause, we celebrate our soldiers and try to prepare them for war, and take care of them if they return from war with trauma. We should do the same for those who take part in carrying out the ultimate sentence in our justice system, instead of deciding that the punishment is the problem.
