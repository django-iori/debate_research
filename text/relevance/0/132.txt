They said that restorative justice as an ideal form of justice; end to this brutal practice and achieve a truly just society. However, one study says that, in Japan approximately 3 prisoners are hanged every year. That leads to reduction in crime rate in Japan. It is correct that, giving death penalty will create psychological fear to the persons those who are willing to commit such crimes in future. Such criminals are considered as predators in the society. There is no reason in arguing up-keeping such predators in the society. Try to understand the capital punishment is an act of justice and not an act of vengeance. It should be seemed as a consequence of disgraceful murderers. So I strongly support the death penalty.
