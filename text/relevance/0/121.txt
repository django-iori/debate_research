They said that because mistakes are human nature, the risk of misjudgment in death sentence cases is too great. However, this argument makes quite a leap in logic. We are exposed to risks due to human error in nearly every aspect of life, yet we accept those risks for the most part. The cost of human error is, admittedly, greater in some instances than others. But death penalty cases aren't alone in carrying a life-or-death risk. When we decide to travel by plane, for instance, we accept the potentially fatal risk of human error on the part of the pilot and air traffic controller. Likewise, a heart surgeon's built-in human error puts all of his patients' lives at risk. The best we can due is to minimize the risk of human error wherever we encounter it. In capital punishment cases, this means demanding effective legal counsel and unbiased juries, as an example.
