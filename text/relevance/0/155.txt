They said that society creates criminals, so society has a burden to rehabilitate them. However, we don't fully understand what causes criminal behavior, making this argument flawed and making rehabilitation a risky prospect. We know that two people with the same experiences and backgrounds may turn out to be quite different in many respects, including their propensity to commit crimes. So, we cannot blame society for making people into criminals, and we cannot expect the criminal justice system to magically transform a criminal into a law-abiding citizen. The roots of criminal behavior are quite complex, and probably include socio-economic circumstances as well as personality type, parenting style, trauma, and even brain chemistry. Without knowing what makes one person turn to a life of crime and another stick to the straight and narrow path, it's practically impossible to know how to change the former into the latter.
