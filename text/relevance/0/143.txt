They said that rehabilitation is the ideal goal of prison, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, who decided that it is more important to rehabilitate prisoners than to punish them? While our Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment, it does not endorse a blanket ban on any form of punishment. In fact, punishment serves a real purpose, because it tends to have more of a deterrent effect than rehabilitation. Punishment also serves as a way to restore justice and a sense of fairness when society or an innocent individual has been wronged by the action of another. Just as we punish a toddler for bad behavior in order to correct and deter the behavior, we should punish perpetrators of crime to prevent further crime. Thus, it is questionable whether rehabilitation rather than punishment should be the aim of prison and of the criminal justice system itself.
