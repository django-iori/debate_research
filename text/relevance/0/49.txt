They said that depriving a criminal of life is inhumane, thus the death penalty is wrong. However, a life sentence is really no more humane than a death sentence. In fact, sentencing a prisoner to life in prison without any chance of parole might as well be a death sentence. A prisoner facing such a sentence has no reason to live or to hope. His existence is like being in purgatory, made to relive every bad decision, without respite from the bitter taste of regret. Moreover, the prisoner sentenced to death is made to suffer every day, for years on end, to endure the hardships of a life confined in a cell, deprived of the ability to breathe fresh air. He is also deprived of meaningful interactions and must live always under threat of attack by another inmate. Such a life is no better than death and no more humane.
