They said that there is no time to do homework. However, this argument assumes that teachers are inflexible when it comes to homework deadlines. In fact, if a student has a legitimate reason for needing extra time for homework, most teachers will be reasonable enough to grant it. This argument also assumes that homework assignments are given on such short notice that it's impossible to get the work done while balancing other activities. In fact, most teachers recognize that kids participate in extra-curricular activities and encourage that participation. Consequently, it is rare for teachers to assign so much homework that it can't possibly be done while also having time for clubs and sports. Having enough time for homework is more a matter of learning how to juggle and balance activities than having to quit one in order to manage the other.
