They said that because it involves killing a human being, the death penalty is wrong and inhumane. However, the fact that we have a death penalty reserved for the most brutal crimes against the innocent demonstrates society's humanity. We do not regard all crimes as equal, and we make a special case for the kind of crimes that threaten the safety and the very structure of society. Without the death penalty, how do we send a message that society will not permit mass murder, sick and sadistic torture killings, and killing sprees in public schools? It is never the goal of the state to take any human life, but the death penalty must exist because depraved criminals must be stopped. That is how society ensures the sanctity of life is not violated.
