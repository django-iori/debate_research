They said that rehabilitation should be the goal when someone is sent to prison for a serious crime, and that goal isn't compatible with the death penalty. However, rehabilitation sounds like a worthy goal: if only we could transform the worst criminals into decent citizens, what a wonderful world it would be! However, the reality of prison rehabilitation programs usually falls far short of any lofty plan. Such programs typically suffer from lack of funding and resources, along with low attendance rates. For those serving life sentences, the motivation to participate is mitigated by the reality that the prisoner is never going to rejoin society anyway. To counteract low participation rates, some prisons force "lifers" to enroll or face consequences such as being placed in solitary confinement or deprived of recreation. In some cases, prisoners are even subjected to questionable behavioral therapy with the supposed goal of rehabilitation but the actual intent of creating compliant inmates.
