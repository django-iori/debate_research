They said that the death sentence doesn't allow a chance to reverse a legal mistake, so it should be abolished. However, actually, the ability to reverse a legal mistake is part of every death row sentence in the form of an automatic appeal. As part of the appeals process, the convicted criminal isn't limited to having his original trial record reviewed. There are a variety of legal issues that the convicted party can exploit in hopes of winning a lesser sentence or gaining release from prison. For instance, he can complain about misconduct by a jury member or lack of effective counsel. He can introduce new evidence into the case, or he can claim that evidence was withheld by the state. Because the appeals process is a right of the death row inmate, there is ample chance for him to prove his true innocence or to gain freedom due to a legal loophole.
