They said that we should abolish the death penalty in favor of rehabilitation. However, this argument does not cite any evidence that rehabilitation of death row inmates works or that it is effective by any measure of success. We know that many ex-cons return to a life of crime after their release, based on recidivism rates. It is also true that violent criminals tend to be more likely to repeat their crimes, and violence is surely a characteristic of most crimes deemed worthy of capital punishment. It is too dangerous to put the safety of society at risk on the chance that death row criminals can be truly rehabilitated. As with all investments, we have to consider the risk-return ratio of any type of punishment. An execution provides a sure result, while rehabilitation is a risky gamble.
