They said that the death penalty should be abolished because it results in an increasingly brutal society as reflected by brutal crimes. However, this argument does not demonstrate a cause and effect relationship whereby capital punishment causes brutality in society, including brutal crimes such as the killing of children by their parents and random murderous sprees. Instead, brutal crimes "cause" capital punishment. The death sentence is only handed down when a crime fitting the definition of capital offense occurs, including mass murder. Moreover, the death sentence intends to reduce the commission of such brutal crimes by serving both as a deterrent against others committing such crimes and by permanently eradicating the source. Without the death penalty as an option, it can thus be argued that the likelihood of such brutal crimes would increase rather than decrease.
