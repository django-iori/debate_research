They said that firstly, the state practicing the death penalty as a form of punishment validates the notion that the taking of someoneâ€™s life is an option, or a valid choice. However, taking someone's life can be a valid choice when it saves more lives or if it is for self-defence. A criminal might be way more dangerous and he might have put victims through very traumatic ordeal and causing them harm. If a state takes weak decisions, it might encourage the criminals that are willing to spend their lives in prison. This would be very bad for the society. Laws should be tough on crime, so the criminal would have a sense or fear and respect for the society.
