They said that students can learn the "incorrect way" to study with homework, so it should be abolished. However, there is no one right way to study, and saying one way to study is right and another is wrong is a subjective value judgment. Studying done in intervals of time, while riding the school bus or waiting for class to start or even while eating lunch is not without value, even if it is not ideal for all students. In this busy modern world, learning how to multi-task is actually a valuable lesson, and one that homework does a good job of teaching. Students can develop the ability to succeed at multi-tasking, for instance, by doing homework while listening to music, or by reciting vocabulary definitions while doing dishes.
