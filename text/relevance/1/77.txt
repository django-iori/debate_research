They said that homework for primary students should be abolished, because some students dislike studying and there are more effective ways to learn than homework. However, students, and all children, need to learn to do things that they dislike as a way to get them acclimated to adult responsibility. Homework is just one of these things, and an important one, but if we were to abolish the effort, we'd soon be leaving students to nothing but play, and in fact we'd probably end up abolishing school entirely, because many students dislike it. There may be more effective teaching methods, but homework is a tried and true method for teaching children not only responsibility, but independence, by teaching them to work without adult guidance, which is absolutely essential to becoming an autonomous adult. So, homework teaches both independence, and responsibility to children, and the practice should be continued.
