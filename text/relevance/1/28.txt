They said that because executioners feel the burden of responsibility, we should abolish the death penalty. However, executioners are not actually responsible for the life or death of an inmate. After all, anyone who sits on death row has been charged with an egregious offense, defended by a lawyer in a courtroom, and then been determined guilty by twelve of their peers. Thus, the executioner only acts as a small cog in the big machine that is the criminal justice system. Consequently, those who take part in the execution don't bear the burden of guilt: if anything, they can blame the criminal himself for choosing to disobey the law, or blame the lawyer for failing to present a strong enough case, or blame the jury for their decision. The executioner is the least responsible and the most blameless, in reality.
