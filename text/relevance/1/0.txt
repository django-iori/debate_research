They said that students should not be forced to learn, but be naturally curious to learn on their own without having homework be obligatory. However, I find that if left to their own devices that students will refuse to learn and actually find it harder to learn on their own. The argument stated above even says it right at the beginning "First: some students tend to dislike studying" The prior argument wants me to believe that students that dislike studying will study on their own. I cannot follow the logic in that argument. I feel that in order to learn how to study a student must be given homework, so they can find value in finding the answer to a problem on their own. It also teaches them responsibility and how to manage their time better. I know that a lot of students enjoy homework, because it allows them to explore certain things to find answers and satisfies their natural curiosity for learning. Homework needs to be assigned to teach students responsibility and foster leaning.
