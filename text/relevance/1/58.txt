They said that students shouldn't be obligated to do homework because studying shouldn't be obliged. However, "Obligation" does not have to have a negative connotation. When homework is defined as obligatory in the sense that it is something forced upon a student, it's no wonder homework gets a bad rap. However, being obligated also means being responsible, fulfilling one's duty, and being committed. If we shift our perspective on homework from something that is forced upon students to something that students take responsibility for, that they fulfill and commit themselves to, the connotation of homework becomes positive. In this sense, homework is a still the duty of a student, but it doesn't have to be a begrudging one.
