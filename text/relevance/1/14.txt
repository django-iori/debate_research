They said that executioners suffer stress, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, there are ways to help minimize, if not eliminate, executioner stress. Rather than toss out a form of punishment that may serve as an effective deterrent, the better solution is to address what is causing executioner stress. Perhaps executioners are stressed because they don't want to hurt a prisoner they work closely with on a daily basis. One way to address this is to choose for the role of executioner prison workers who don't otherwise have contact with death row inmates. Another way is to ensure that executions themselves are as painless as possible, and make sure that executioners understand that the penalty is carried out in the most humane manner available.
