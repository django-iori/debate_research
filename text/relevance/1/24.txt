They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to the chance that a criminal will kill in order to end his own life. However, the death penalty is imposed so rarely -- and so slowly -- that it hardly serves as an effective tool for the criminal bent on "suicide by state". The sentence of death is handed down in a tiny fraction of court cases, requiring a unanimous jury verdict, an abundance of unquestionable evidence, and -- most significantly -- requiring the commission of the most heinous crime fitting the definition of a capital offense. After the verdict of death is rendered, a prisoner typically sits on death row for ten years or more. It isn't rare for a prisoner to await the death sentence for decades. Moreover, most cases involving a sentence of capital punishment result in conversion to a life sentence. Thus, unlike "suicide by cop" which does occur comparatively frequently and instantly, capital punishment isn't a practical way to achieve suicide by the state.
