They said that since some students dislike studying, we should do away with homework. However, rather than doing away with homework, we should try to figure out why some students are averse to studying, then figure out ways to combat that aversion. Avoiding the subject by abolishing homework doesn't get at the root of the problem. Perhaps students dislike studying because of a learning issue that needs to be addressed. Or, students may dislike studying because they can't see how it matters or they find the subject boring. Teachers can overcome these obstacles by assigning homework in the area of the student's interest and by creating homework assignments that are meaningful rather than mundane repetition. Finally, if the problem is simply that students dislike studying because it's work, teachers can create homework that doesn't seem like work, and they can use homework to teach students the value of doing their work by rewarding completed assignments.
