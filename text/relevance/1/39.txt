They said that executing an inmate causes executioners to suffer, so we must abolish the death penalty. However, in death penalty cases, there is always going to be suffering, but the executioner's pain is nothing compared to the victim's. In addition, the executioner's suffering can be minimized, but the victim's often cannot. One way to help executioner's reduce their sense of stress and pain over partaking in this punishment is to understand the power of delivering justice and closure to the victim and their loved ones. Before the execution date, the would-be executioner should meet with the survivors of the crime, to understand their pain and what relief they will achieve from the execution. By sharing and empathizing with the victims, the executioner's own suffering will be lessened and a sense of peach can be achieved by all.
