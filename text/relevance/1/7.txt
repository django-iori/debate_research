They said that homework will make them passive in character. The assumption is if schools abolish homework, students can become active in character. However,  it is not true. That is to say if abolishing homework, students become passive in character. This is because students are instructed by teachers in club activity or cram school in many situation. For example if you go to the cram school, the teachers give you a lot of homework. Moreover parents instructed their children to study in their house. So in both paradigms students are likely to be passive in character.
