They said that homework should be abolished since school is not a place where students only learn to study. However, studying remains a key purpose of school, if not THE key purpose. To say that we should do away with homework because students should be learning how to live instead is a recipe for disaster. We need to prepare students for the real world by giving them a foundation of basic skills. Homework is one way to reinforce these basic skills, including reading, writing and arithmetic. Too often today, we expect schools and teachers to fill roles unrelated to teaching -- expecting teachers to serve as nannies and nurses and counselors, instead of their vital role of passing on knowledge. Homework is still one of the best tools a teacher has to reinforce and extend what is taught in the classroom.
