They said that the death penalty removes any chance of rehabilitation of the criminal, merely ending the life of the perpetrator and offering no chance for reflection, remorse, or most importantly, redemption. However, society needs to be able to send a message that certain behaviors are beyond redemption. There are some specific acts—a category of crime, if you will—that are so heinous, so reprehensible, and so outside the confines of any semblance of civilization, that the only response from a sane public is to eliminate the person(s) responsible. Situations like Sandy Hook, like Columbine, like 9/11 are operating on a level of criminality that is above and beyond any hope or possibility of forgiveness. There is no "coming back" from horrors such as these. There is no "moving on" after visiting such atrocities on the world. For that reason, death is the only viable solution. Criminals such as these are akin to cancerous growths that must be removed in order for the world to function; the message must be sent that their worst actions will be met with our most extreme response: death.
