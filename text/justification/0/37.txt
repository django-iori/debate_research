They said that even though the there was serious crime committed by the criminal, it cannot be a good reason to deprive the life of the criminal by the nation. However, nations deprive lives of people when it comes to war. Nations have always taken up tough measures to protect and safeguard people which sometimes involve killing the people who harm them. It is a self-defence mechanism where being tough on the attacker would save the lives of innocent people. The nation should also think about deterring crime by being tough on criminals so injustice and crime is controlled. The nation should appear strong and if it takes a softer stance on the criminals it might encourage crime which is highly counterproductive.
