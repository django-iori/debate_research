They said that the death penalty should be abolished because mistakes made in these cases can't be reversed. However, this argument assumes that the death sentence is carried out before a mistake can be found. In fact, inmates typically spend years and often decades on death row. This allows time to catch mistakes made in the original trial and rectify them. A great many death row sentences are reduced to life sentences on appeal, which demonstrates that a death sentence isn't absolute. Moreover, death penalty cases represent a much larger percentage of total exonerations, where the original charges are dismissed altogether. This further suggests that death sentences can be changed and that death row inmates actually have a greater chance of obtaining justice, due to the extraordinary amount of focus on their cases.
