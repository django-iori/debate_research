They said that present situation are lack of free time for students and students cannot do what really they want, so homework should be abolished. However, not all students are lack of time in present situation. For example, I belonged to Judo club in junior high and high school and I could join extracurricular activity that I wanted to join in, but I could implement homework and I could guarantee enough time for sleeping. Even if homework is accumulated, some people can control the tasks. It is also training to manage having time in school. Therefore, lack of time is not necessarily caused by a lot of homework, but lack of management skills, therefore, the government opinion is rejected.
