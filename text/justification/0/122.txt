They said that prisoners deserve to be rehabilitated, so the death penalty is wrong. However, rehabilitation, like criminal behavior, is largely a matter of choice. Unless someone wants to be rehabilitated, no amount of spiritual counseling, vocational training and therapy is going to change that person. In the case of criminals found guilty of capital crimes that carry the death penalty -- including mass murder and terrorism -- the possibility of real rehabilitation is even more remote. Yes, we can increase participation in rehabilitation programs by offering enticements such as extra TV time or family visits, but this strategy is a bit like bribing a toddler with a treat: the results are likely to be short-term at best, and the effect tends to disappear when the incentive is removed. Moreover, we need to recognize that criminals learn to manipulate the system, so can we really trust a mass murderer who claims to have repented and seen the light?
