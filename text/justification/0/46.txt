They said that society is safer when the death penalty is abolished because it risks loss of innocent lives. However, you have to consider the deterrent effect of the death penalty when deciding whether abolishing it actually leads to fewer innocent lives lost. In addition to future innocent lives that can be taken by a criminal who is given a sentence other than death, we must remember the countless innocent lives that are potentially saved because the death penalty remains an option in the criminal justice system. Because the threat of death by execution keeps even a small percent of would-be murderers from killing, capital punishment helps protect society. Removing the death penalty sends a message that innocent lives are not valuable enough to warrant this most effective safeguard.
