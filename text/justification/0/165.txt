They said that criminals should stay in jail forever because of rehabilitation possibilities,  and because of the idea that society creates criminals in the first place. However, i respectfully argue that there are many flaws in your argument. First of all, i don't believe there is any thing that guarantees a person who receives a life sentence will actually spend the rest of their life in jail. Factors such as good behavior, pleas to parole boards and other factors sometimes make the term "life sentence" meaningless. Just as important is your argument that the person serving a life sentence will continue to spend their life reflecting on what they did. How can we assume that is the case? We don't know what percentage of the time he is doing any reflecting at all. There is just as much of a chance that he is reflecting on whether to use the prison library or watch the prison television. The problem with your argument is you are thinking about the murderer and not the victim. Thank you.
