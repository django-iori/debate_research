They said that students learn a right way and wrong way to study from having homework that they copy off other students. However, for this argument, I would like to ask what is a right way to study? Is course work in general not just memorizing work? There is no wrong way to study, people learn in different speeds and in different ways. In fact, copying the homework could lead to a better understanding due to having to write out the answer. Repetition is usually a good learning technique. Some people learn faster than others and who is to say that students that are copying work aren't the ones who understand the work and are okay with just copying it? The point is also flawed since copying homework will not effect the class as much as passing a test. If a student does copy homework, but aces the test, they understand the material and understand how to study.
