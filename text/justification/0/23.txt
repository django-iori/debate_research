They said that the inhumane nature of the death penalty means it should be abolished. However, inhumanity is a relative term, and whether it applies to the death penalty is a subjective determination. If we really care whether a sentence is humane or not, then we should leave the choice up to the accused. It wouldn't be surprising to discover that not just a few prisoners would choose a quick, painless death sentence over the prospect of life behind bars without the chance of parole. A life spent in a prison cell, without any hope of ever being set free, would seem to meet the definition of inhumane, yet that is the alternative offered. Likewise, instead of being put to death, in many instances those who commit heinous crimes are subjected to interminable solitary confinement. This is almost surely more cruel and inhumane, based on what we now know about the human need for social interaction.
