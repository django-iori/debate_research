They said that lose to students characters. However, it's not true. Because, 
being forced is not a bad thing. Because you haven't proven how much coercion on your side takes away the character of the students. Nor does the point stand because it doesn't even state how much of a burden homework is on students when it's forced. Also, we can't see about how many students are feel it's problem. On this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.
