They said that government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. However, I dont agree with the original argument that government has the responsibility . No government encourages any person to do a crime. Government has the responsibility not to create the criminals but to stop crimes happening in the country by giving punishments giving to the criminals. And not all the criminals are sentenced to death. It depended upon so many do's and don;t condition that the law has created for the criminals. It is not punishing just like that.
