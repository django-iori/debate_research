They said that since some students don't like studying, it should be abolished. They shouldn't be obliged to study. However, this argument doesn't make much sense. Most students don't like going to school, but we shouldn't abolish school. Most kids don't like chores or taking baths, but we don't talk about abolishing cleaning. The fact is that homework has been a part of our school system forever and it shouldn't be changed now. If we give kids the option to not do homework, of course they won't do it. But that would mean that they lose out on opportunities to learn more. Homework drills the stuff into their heads. Without homework, kids would forget most of what they learn. That's why most schools give Summer assignments, because its been proven that kids forget tons of what they learned while on summer vacation.
