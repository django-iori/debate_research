They said that homework should be abolished because students tend to dislike studying. However, if teachers assign work judiciously, giving creative and thought-provoking assignments, homework is a tool for reviewing what was studied in class, and preparing for the next day's work. Homework needn't be the drudgery of rote memorization and repetitive questions. An assignment could incorporate art, observation of subjects being used in everyday life: for example baking uses math. Rather than abolishing, homework should be modified. Possible compromises might be no homework for the weekends or holidays, one subject per night, or homgnework given every other day. Dosing assignments helps reinforce materials taught, and should be modified, not abolished.
