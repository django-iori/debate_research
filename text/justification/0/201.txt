They said that some students tend to dislike studying and there are more effective learning ways than homework. However, most of the people do not like to take medicine, but it is necessary for them. Study is a good medicine for human's mental health. There are very few no. of brilliant and talented students who can memorize their lessons by just learning or listening once. But for most of the students to gain skill for a lesson, the only way is to practice. But for a teacher in a 40 to 60 min. session, it is impossible to teach and give practice of a lesson to a no. of students in a class. So for the general students there is no alternative of "homework" to learn studing, to practice and to become a master of a subject.
