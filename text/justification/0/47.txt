They said that some students tend to dislike studying. However, it is not always true. In many cases, school homework can provide opportunity to like studying. For example, if some students forced to write diary everyday it might seem to be tough thing at the first time. But if you continue the writing diary, parents or teacher will reward your expression or your interest and experience. You would feel pleasure from these message and review and you will want to be a novelist in the future. Like this not all student be dislike study rather it can be a chance to be like study.
