They said that some students tend to dislike studying and forcing homework to children is one of the reasons of it, thus homework should be abolished. However, even if it is true, then why should we prior “some” children who dislike studying to other children who like or can do studying well in the first place. For the latter children, abolishing homework is robbing what they want to do or what they can do well. Therefore, government should explain it, and if they can’t, what Prime Minister said is not the effective reason to abolish homework.
