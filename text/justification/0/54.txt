They said that the death penalty doesn't make society safer because innocent people can be killed. However, this argument ignores the many ways that the death penalty protects society from harm. By permanently removing the most dangerous criminals from society, the death penalty serves as a safeguard against the loss of future lives. Furthermore, by serving to deter others from committing crimes that carry a death sentence, including mass murder and terrorism, the death penalty prevents additional casualties. Executions also protect fellow inmates and prison workers from the threat of death or injury at the hands of a violent criminal given a sentence other than capital punishment. So, when you balance the tiny number of truly innocent people who are executed against the many future lives that can be spared by retaining the death penalty, it's clear that this sentence keeps society safer.
