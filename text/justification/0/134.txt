They said that it could be an innocent person at the wrong place at the wrong time. However, it is impossible that an innocent person is getting sentenced to death. Since the judgement is given not by a single judge. It is scrutinized by a team of judges who after discussing and getting evidences for the crime only they are giving their judgement. We cant take it granted for hundred to one innocent case. Even if it is a wrong judgement it is not a recurring one and not an intentional one.
