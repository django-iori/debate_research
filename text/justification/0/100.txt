They said that the stress put on executioners means the death penalty should be abolished. However, if executioner stress is the issue, then the most direct answer is to find a way to lower that stress, rather than to get rid of a legal option for punishing criminals. There are actually a number of ways to minimize the stress of executions for those who take part in them. In addition to the example given, where none of the guards knows who pushes the 'kill' switch, executioners can rotate jobs, get extra counseling and days off, and get assurance that the death-row inmate has been made comfortable and will fill no pain. Moreover, if the executioner knows that the inmate himself is prepared to accept his death, then feelings of guilt can be reduced. These are better solutions than abolishing an effective deterrent.
