They said that the death penalty should be abolished and replaced. However, the situation and circumstances of the argument presented are completely made up. Hanging has not been used since 1996. I have studied this before and the supposed argument presented here is no argument at all. All states use the method of lethal injection which is painless and non-violent. Individuals sentenced to death are beyond any type of saving and keeping them alive is a waste of taxpayer money. There is no such thing as executioner stress. The argument against the death penalty also lacks context.
