They said that homework needs help from the students parents and its not good. However, it won't be a sufficient reason to abolish homework. If homework needs help from parents, the teacher can do something for the students. For example, they can hold office hours, they can write a comment on the homework, they can explain the difficult part in the class and they can distribute the explanation sheet afterward. There are many alternative ways to solve this problem and it's enough. Homework gave from high school is too difficult for parents to help, but there are no big problems. Therefore, their argument doesn't stand.
