They said that if there is a misjudgement it will be irrepareable. However, but my point is all judgement can not be misjudged. Some criminal offenses and corresponding criminals are identified as clear as day light. Some of these criminals regrets for their doings and they feel sorrow for what happened. But some criminals make happen the incident with long plans and cold head. They also have no regret for their doing. They do not feel sorry or even they do not accept that what they made happen were wrong. Actually they are not the part of humanity and society. A longer life of their is the threat to other human and society. It increase the doubts and distrust between people. So it is safe for society to eliminate these creature without spending time and money for them. To ensure safety and belief it is necessary that Death penalty should not be abolished.
