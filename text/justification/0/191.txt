They said that "Fairness" is an important point on the homework debate. However, it's not true. That's because it is not a mutually exclusive point. That's to say, we believe we cannot tackle down the fairness problem with abolishing homework. That's because children whose parents are keen on their children's education will provide additional education to their children instead of homework. For example, they might send their children to cram school. They might create new homework by themselves. That's the reason why we believe abolishing homework is meaningless to tackle down the gap problem. So we believe that it's not an important point in this debate.
