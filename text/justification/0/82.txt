They said that the inhumanity of the death penalty makes it wrong. However, "Inhumanity" is a subjective term, so calling the death penalty inhumane is just an opinion. When the poet Robert Burns coined the phrase "Man's inhumanity to man" he was perhaps deliberately vague, referring to the cruelty that seems inherent in human nature rather than to any particular instance, including executions. Yet, when we consider some synonyms for "inhumane" -- callous, sadistic, merciless -- it becomes apparent that they do not fit the modern reality of state-sanctioned executions. Executions today are carried out with medical professionals present to ensure the death row inmate doesn't suffer needlessly. In fact, a sedating drug is given so the prisoner is in the same state as an anesthetized patient on an operating table. This can't be considered inhumane.
