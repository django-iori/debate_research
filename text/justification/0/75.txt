They said that a school is not a place where students only learn to study. However, it is not true. We strongly believe that school should prioritize the quality of study rather than making student passive because academic background is more important than passive character. Currently, many business corporations often evaluate obedient people because corporations consisted by many stuffs and require spirit of cooperation. So, even if student are passive they can join such companies, if they have enough level of education. So we are concern that academic skills are much important than passive character.
