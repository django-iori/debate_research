They said that we can get free time. However, it's not true. Because, if you give students free time, they will lose their crispness. If we only have free time, the gap between students will be obvious. For example, if schools admit government side idea. Some students are doing study and they can keep score. But at this time, some students are not doing study and they can't keep good score. This is very big problem in education. On this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.
