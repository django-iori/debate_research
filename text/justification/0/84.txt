They said that  if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. However, it is not absolutely true. Off course, many students need to go club activities or clam school. But they can do more good time management to do homework. For example, during class, they can do homework with hearing the lessons. Or, on a holiday, they can do homework for the week in advance. By working on better time management, it will help their future work. So their argument is not true.
