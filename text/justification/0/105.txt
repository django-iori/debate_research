They said that students should study based on their curiosity. However, it is not a important point in this debate. This is because they can study based on their curiosity even if they have some homework. For example, they can go to museums after finishing their homework during summer vacation. They can study their favorite subjects after finishing their homework. That's to say, they have some free time to study based on their curiosity even if they have some homework. That's the reason why we believe that even if studying based on curiosity is important thing, students can do that even without abolishing homework.
