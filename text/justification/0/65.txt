They said that death penalty should be abolished. However, we cannot abolish the death penalty. Too many victims have lost their lives to evil people. These evil people need to suffer that same fate. The families of the victims need justice. Life is prison is not justice. It’s a slap in the face to the victims abs their families. Anyone who mentions the cruelty of the death penalty must have forgotten some of the acts these inmates committed. Where is the passion and sympathy for the victims? Let’s honor them and their loved ones and stop advocating for the rights of their murderers.
