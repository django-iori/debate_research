They said that executioners feel responsible for killing, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, this issue isn't with the death penalty as a form of punishment, but with the effect on the executioner. So, that is what we should focus on solving. In some ways, it's hard to understand why an executioner should feel responsible, when they are merely carrying out orders. However, we can take steps to help remove the burden of guilt and responsibility nonetheless. For instance, like the example cited above where multiple prison officers push a button, we could have every person on duty line up to press a button -- from the prison warden down to the cafeteria workers. By increasing the pool of participants, no one would think they were the one that dealt the fatal punishment, and we could keep the death penalty on the books for the worst offenses.
