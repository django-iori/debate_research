They said that there may be an intentional abuse of the system. However, given the example about the man in Hokkaido in 2016, this argument doesn't hold up. It's wrong to say that we know for certain that if the worst punishment was life in prison, the man wouldn't have killed. This is leaving things to theory or relying on a hypothetical scenario. The man did in fact commit a crime and should be punished. We can't base an argument on something that may have happened, we need to rely on facts.
