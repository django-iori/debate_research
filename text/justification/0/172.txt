They said that homework should be abolished because the responsibility of schools is to finish all work within the school itself and also because students don't have equal support systems outside of school. However, although homework can be unfair for students who have more knowledgeable and involved parents and siblings to help them with their studies, the benefits of homework outweigh the inequality of homework. Students are supposed to be taught and provided every resource they need to complete their homework with or without family's help. Even though one student might have an easier time if he can get his brother or mother to help him complete an assignment, he won't learn how to do the assignment himself the way another student who can't ask his family for help will, which balances out the disadvantages in the long term.
