They said that we should abolish the death penalty because executioners feel responsible for killing. However, it is not the executioner who is responsible when a death row inmate dies. The executioner is powerless to choose life or death for the prisoner, so he bears no blame. We can't abolish a legal and effective form of punishment simply because prison officials who participate in executions have a conscience. In fact, this just shows that people in the criminal justice system aren't evil, and that they do empathize with even the worst members of society. This is in contrast to the criminal who shows no empathy for his victims. So, an executioner who feels responsible should be educated to understand that the decision of life or death rests with the court system, and that the choice to do wrong is solely the fault of the criminal.
