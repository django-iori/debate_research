They said that students conduct homework in the inefficient and incorrect ways, so homework should be abolished. However, even if the way for students to conduct homework is not good, it does not deny the system of homework. In the first place, whether students address hard or not is depending on studentsâ€™ will and some people get advantage and acquire enough ability from homework. Therefore, homework in itself is not harmful and conducting homework is not harmful efforts. If we make homework more efficient and effective, we should change the way of homework. The logic that homework should be abolished is too leaping.
