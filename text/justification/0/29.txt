They said that there is no room in the student's schedule for homework. However, fitting activities into a frequently busy schedule is a life skill that homework helps teach and that proves useful beyond school. Learning how to make a schedule is a worthy lesson, and it is just one of the benefits of assigning homework. When a student gets a homework assignment, he has a few choices: create a schedule with a time slot for doing the homework, hope he remembers to do the work without creating a schedule, or ignore the assignment in favor of another way to spend time after class. When the latter methods fail and negative consequences (like a failing grade) result, the student eventually learns that the way to succeed is by making time for important tasks, and the best tool for doing that is a schedule.
