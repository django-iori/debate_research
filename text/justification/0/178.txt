They said that homework is harmful because it encourages bad study habits by kids too busy to do it. However, the arguments made are not entirely invalid. Obviously, kids today have busy schedules and it's tempting to 'cheat' or cut corners when it comes to homework. But, the solution isn't doing away with homework, since homework serves a valuable purpose by reinforcing classroom lessons. A better solution is to get more creative with homework. Teachers can give homework assignments that better fit into their students' busy modern lives. For instance, homework assignments can incorporate some activities that already occupy after-school schedules. Creative homework ideas include plotting a story based on video game play, or applying chemistry principles to preparing a meal for the family. Moreover, these kind of assignments can't be copied from another student.
