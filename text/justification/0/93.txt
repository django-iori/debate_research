They said that the second point is “Rehabilitation”. However, I dont think that rehabilitation is a word or action that suits a criminal. The rehabilitation must be related to people who are helpless like orphans and the action of restoring someone to health or normal life through training when they committed a crime in pressure and in an unavoidable situation. If rehabilitation is given to those who have a serious crime then every one will do crimes and ask for rehabilitation punishment.
