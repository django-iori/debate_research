They said that intentional abuse of the system is bad. However, the author writes in their argument that "intentional abuse of the system is bad". I feel like this is such a miniscule part of death penalty cases that it is completely irrelevant. In my life time I have not heard of a single case of this happening, even someone who is mentally ill probably understands that there are consequences to their actions, even if they feel no remorse for doing so. The death penalty is relevant and effective.
