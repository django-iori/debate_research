They said that rehabilitation of criminals, not capital punishment, is what we should strive for. However, the idea of being able to transform a criminal into a contributing member of society is a lofty ideal. If it worked, and if we had evidence of its success, rehabilitation might be the ultimate goal of prison. However, we don't have a formula for how to rehabilitate prisoners whose criminal behavior has multiple and often unknown causes. And, even if we had such a formula, we still wouldn't have the vast resources to implement it. Rehabilitation requires a combination of measures, including academic education, vocational training, behavioral therapy, medication, and spiritual counseling. Keeping prisoners behind bars is expensive enough without adding a whole team of rehabilitation experts to the budget. The death penalty, when it is delivered swiftly, is far more cost effective.
