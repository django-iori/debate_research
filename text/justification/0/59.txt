They said that there can be mistakes in sentencing therefor to prevent an innocent person from being killed death penalty should be abolished. However, it cost money to keep someone in jail and that money come from tax payers. Why keep criminals who have committed heinous acts alive costing us money. Technology now has improved so much. It is practically impossible that someone is  wrongfully convicted. I'm not saying the death penalty should be easy to just give out to someone. There must be irrefutable evidence against them to make sure an innocent person is not sentenced. People make mistakes but the death penalty is given to people who knowingly commit the crime.
