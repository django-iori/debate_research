They said that society will be safer if we eliminate the death penalty, which costs innocent lives. However, it is virtually impossible to compare the number of lives that could be saved if we eliminated the death penalty, versus the number of lives that might be lost if the option of capital punishment were taken away. The exact number of truly innocent death row inmates who have been executed is unknown. Moreover, we cannot know the number of innocent people who would become victims of a criminal who might have been deterred by the death penalty. There are too many unknown variables to make this a valid argument. Instead, we can only assume that while a tiny number of wrongfully convicted people have been executed, that number pales in comparison to the innocent lives saved because a murderer was executed and because a would-be murderer was deterred.
