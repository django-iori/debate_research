They said that teacher always take care of students and manage what they need to do. However, it is not true, because teachers have capacity to see each student. In order to judge studentsâ€™ ability, teachers put on homework. Thus, students have to plan their schedule. For example, they have to calculate the time for homework. Furthermore, given homework, they can automatically notice their study ability. By those tendency, they improve their study plan. In those processes, teacher donot intervene each student. Therefore, even in current situation, students always manage what they need to do, and teachers are testing the management ability through homework.
