They said that obliging students to do homework when they don't like studying is a bad thing. However, all of us have obligations, and the sooner kids learn that shirking obligations is a bad thing, the better. For instance, employees have an obligation to perform the jobs they are paid to do. Likewise, kids have an obligation to get out of bed in the morning to go to school. The obligation to do homework is just one of the many obligations that kids will encounter in life. Teaching kids that they don't have to do work because they dislike working is not a good idea. Fulfilling obligations can actually be rewarding as well. For instance, taking care of your pet is rewarding because it helps you bond with your pet. So, denying kids the rewards that come with carrying out obligations -- including homework -- is just unfair.
