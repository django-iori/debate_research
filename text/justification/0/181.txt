They said that homework should be abolished. However, homework should not be abolished because it is an effective and efficient way to determine if the students are absorbing the skills taught in the classroom. It may take an entire class period to teach, say, a math concept, and it isn't practical to test how well the lesson was received by the students in any remaining (and rushed) time. Running through a few problems at home and then going over the work the next day in class is less stressful on the students. Further, there are some skills that improve with repetition; the more one does multiplications, for example, the better one gets at them. Doing this repetition at home is an efficient use of time since it won't cut into class time.
