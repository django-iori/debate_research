They said that the death penalty is inhumane because no crime is so serious that it should result in death imposed by the nation-state. However, compared to the inhumanity of the kind of heinous crime that results in the death penalty, capital punishment is humane and civil. In modern times, every effort is made to remove pain from the penalty. In the case of death by lethal injection, for instance, a sedative is given first so that the prisoner is basically asleep and anesthetized when the deadly dose is delivered. Contrast the sterility and civility of the modern execution with the absolute brutality and inhumane lack of empathy that killers demonstrate toward their victims. Society needs to have the death penalty as an option precisely because some crimes are so serious and brutal that no other punishment is sufficient. Random killing sprees and acts of terrorism, which exemplify man's inhumanity to men, are just two examples.
