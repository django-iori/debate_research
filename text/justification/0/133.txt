They said that government has the responsibility because they made the society that created the criminals. However, there has always been crime even before governments implemented any kind of justice. Justice was established in order to enforce the laws that were enacted in order for society to function. The people who do not abide by these laws need to have repercussions for not following these laws. In the case of crimes against someone where their life is taken or where someone is harmed for life there needs to be a type of justice that not only punishes the criminal but deters those who would commit those crimes in the future. When we take away harsh punishment people are not as deterred. Government did not cause the crimes but it is because the government is too lax that the crimes are commited.
