They said that as a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. However, I understand that it is important to have free time to do various hobbies and activities, especially with friends. I'm not arguing that that is not important in someone's life. My argument is that if there is an overwhelming amount of homework, then you may have to change your schedule to be able to have time to do it. If you implement your schedule and set aside a certain amount of time every day to do your homework, you will still have time to do all of your other activities. Homework is not the problem, it's your personal schedule.
