They said that when we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. However, creating a safe society with less crime is inevitable and  you cant say that the death penalty has no impact on public safety. If there is no punishment the country will become a place of criminals who will not think about the society and will do crimes without thinking how it affects the society as a whole and they will become a role model to more criminals without thinking about the punishment they are going to get.
