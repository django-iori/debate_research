They said that first, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. However, in general misjudgements in the legal system are fairly rare and most judgements are found to be appropriate upon review. Particularly in the situation when a death penalty is sought the standard for determining the guilt of the accused is raised considerably higher than the standard used in most other cases. So the judge and jury already realize that they really have to look in depth at the situation.

During the appeals process different evidence can be produced based on the particular reason that guilt was determined. The defendant can also change their legal team if they believe that they are being represented poorly.
