They said that students get a passing score if they finish homework even when they copy another's work, so homework should be abolished. However, abolishing homework because some students cheat is unwise because it ends up depriving all students of the academic and other benefits of homework because of the bad choices of some. Moreover, students who cheat by plagiarizing work need to learn a lesson. Simply doing away with homework deprives these students of the chance to learn that lesson and actually rewards them for cheating. In addition, it is a bit naive to think that teachers can't discern when students have copied their work from a classmate or other source. So, students who consistently cheat by copying work are unlikely to get a passing score consistently in reality.
