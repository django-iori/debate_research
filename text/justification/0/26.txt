They said that being obliged will lead to problems between family. However, they might believe obliging homework can trigger family conflict, but it is not true, rather it is beneficial to generate some opportunity to communicate between the family. Let me imagine, if children have some questions about their homework, they will ask their parent and it will be good chance to deeply communicate. However, without homework from school, children have never study in home, so such kind of good opportunity does not occur in their paradigm. So we think their argument is not true.
