They said that the death penalty is simply too inhumane to be applied. However, our Constitution includes a protection against imposition of cruel and unusual punishment, yet the death penalty has withstood attempts to strike it down completely. Instead, the conditions for applying the death penalty have evolved, just as society's understanding of crime has evolved. Today, we consider it cruel and unusual to impose a death sentence on a juvenile, because we now know the brains of young offenders aren't fully formed so they don't fully comprehend consequences. We also now consider it cruel and unusual to execute those who lack the mental capacity to understand right and wrong. These changes to how and when the death penalty is imposed reflect society's humanity rather than its inhumanity.
