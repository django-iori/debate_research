They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to causing stress to the suffering the executioner faces and the cruelty of the death penalty. However, I do not think that abolishing the death penalty would be effective. The reason for this is that life imprisonment poses a huge financial burden on the local community. You have to house the inmate, provide food for the inmate, and also healthcare. You could be looking at millions of dollars over the life of the inmate that the local community has to pay for. That is not fair to the community that the prison or jail is located in. The inmate does not deserve "humanity", or "sympathy". The crimes that they committed are severe enough for the death penalty. The second point of executioners suffering, is flawed because the executioner is performing this role voluntarily. If they are traumatized by it, then they should select a different career path.
