They said that the death penalty should be abolished because it is cruel. However, I feel that it is the crime itself that was cruel, and that it would be cruel to leave society at large at risk of being re-victimized. The prisoner is treated with compassion prior to the death penalty being carried out, such as being given time to write a goodbye letter. This is something that crime victims do not get the curtesy of. The death penalty is also carried out in a swift manner to be as painless as possible.
