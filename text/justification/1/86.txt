They said that the role of school is to teach basic skill. However, in order to fulfill this role of school, rather homework is necessary. That's because homework is a essential tool to establish basic understanding and knowledge. For example, through doing homework, children can practice how to use some formula or how to solve some problems. Even if the understanding of children about what teachers said isn't enough at first, thanks to homework they can review effectively. So, given their logic, abolishing homework is contradictory.
