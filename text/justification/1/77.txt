They said that homework leads some students to memorize the incorrect way to study. However, what Prime Minister said can be solved by alternative ways, because the cause of this problem is not homework itself but the contents of homework in the first place. For example, if the amount of homework is too much, we can reduce it, or if homework is difficult for some, we can adjust the level of it as each student. Therefore, what Prime Minister said is not the reason to abolish homework.
