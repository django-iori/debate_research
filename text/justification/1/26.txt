They said that the death penalty is too inhumane, so it must end. However, despite attempts to ban the death penalty as "cruel and unusual", the Supreme Court has upheld its validity as a punishment. In fact, our Constitution includes a protection against punishments deemed cruel and unusual, the term applied in the Eighth Amendment. To date, this terminology has been successfully applied to execution of individuals who are mentally incompetent or who have not reached adulthood, but not to the death penalty itself. On the contrary, society considers death a just punishment for the worst crimes, committed with cruel deliberation and wanton disregard for the victims' lives. In this sense, the death penalty is a very humane punishment because it restores justice, closure and humanity to the victims and their surviving loved ones.
