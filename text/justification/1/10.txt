They said that prison workers who take part in executions suffer stress, so the death penalty should be eliminated. However, instead of abolishing a punishment that the Constitution endorses, we should find ways to effectively deal with executioner stress. Obviously, if the job involves carrying out executions on a daily basis, without relief or counseling, the executioner is going to feel bad and probably exhibit PTSD. We can combat that by making sure would-be executioners are fully prepared for the job, that they are mentally sound and have a good support system. In addition, we can relieve the stress of dealing with executions day in and day out by rotating the task so the number of executions carried out by a single guard is limited. In this way, executioner stress is reduced and the ultimate penalty can remain a legal option for the worst crimes.
