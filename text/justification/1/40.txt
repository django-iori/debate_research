They said that even commission of a serious crime isn't a good reason for the nation-state to deprive the life of the criminal. However, our Constitution holds that no individual should be deprived of life, liberty, or property "without due process of law". In other words, the nation-state can impose a sentence of death as long as the accused is given due process of law. This assurance is the difference between a civil society and a lawless one. Likewise, the Constitution prohibits punishment that is "cruel and unusual." Hence, the nation-state does not partake in torture to elicit confessions or brutally execute the condemned by guillotine. At the same time, the Constitution upholds the validity of the death sentence as long as it is imposed in a civil and just manner instead of being applied capriciously and barbarically.
