They said that death penalty needs to be banned because it's cruel. However, sparing the lives of hardcore criminals will cause innocent people to experience more misery. This adds more cruelness to society as a whole. We should not spare the lives of these criminals because then fear will be taken away and more crimes will be committed. People will be more willing to commit large crimes since the death penalty is not something looming that might happen if one is caught committing a heinous crime.
