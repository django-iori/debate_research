They said that there isn't enough time to prove innocence when someone is on death row, so capital punishment should be ended. However, in the real world, executions are hardly carried out swiftly. It often takes years from the time someone is charged with a capital offense until they are tried and convicted. During that time, the defendant and his lawyer have ample opportunity to gather evidence and formulate a defense. Furthermore, once a death sentence is handed down, the prisoner is still facing an average of a decade or so before his actual execution date. These years spent on death row provide a chance to make multiple appeals and exhaust all the legal avenues to correct a wrongful execution. Thus, if evidence of innocence exists, a shortage of time is not a barrier to overturning a death sentence.
