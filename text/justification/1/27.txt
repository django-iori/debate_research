They said that homework should be abolished. However, abolishing homework is not going to improve the time management of individuals like this. You take away homework, they will find other things to take up that time and will still go to bed late. They will be committed to more activities that will drain their time. You also are taking away a students chance to show you that they can handle a lot on their plate. This shows you as an educator who can be leases. Who can effectively manage their responsibilities to academics, while doing things outside of the school day such as sports and clubs. Colleges always look at these things. It gives them an idea of the type of student they will be getting. Getting rid of homework in favor of more time for social activities, will not benefit the student. Itâ€™s teaching them the wrong way to handle responsibility.
