They said that homework should be abolished because teaching is the responsibility of schools. However, homework gives students a sense of ownership of learning. By assigning homework, teachers are giving a lesson in responsibility, a vital skill in every aspect of life. When students take responsibility for completing homework assignments in an environment lacking the rigid oversight of the classroom, they gain independence and self-discipline. Moreover, parents should actually play a minor role in homework, so kids without available parents to assist in homework are not penalized. That is because the ideal homework assignment draws on the foundational skills taught in class and encourages kids themselves to apply what they have learned, which reinforces learning and makes students the proud owners of their education.
