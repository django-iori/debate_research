They said that students who copy homework work get passing scores without understanding how to study properly. However, you could apply this same logic to test taking: students who copy test answers from their neighbor can pass a test without understanding the material. But not many people would argue that this is a valid reason to do away with testing. In fact, you could argue that this is a good teaching opportunity for learning about ethics and the consequences of one's choices. Students who copy answers on tests and homework run the risk of copying bad work as well as the risk of getting caught and facing repercussions like failure or expulsion. Students also learn, over time, that copying work is counter to actually studying and learning the material. Abolishing testing or homework deprives students of the chance to learn this.
