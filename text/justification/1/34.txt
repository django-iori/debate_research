They said that homework keeps kids from doing more of what they really want to do, so it should be abolished. However, if every kid were perfect, this argument might make sense. "Perfect" kids choose only wholesome, productive activities to fill their after-school time with. These kids have hobbies like Scouting, volunteering at a pet rescue, or learning a new language. These kids spend their time taking piano lessons, playing chess online, and interacting with their parents and siblings. However, we know that real kids aren't perfect. The kind of things kids "really want to do" tend to include surfing questionable Internet sites, playing violent video games, and watching TV shows and movies that are not G-rated. Homework assignments serve the important role of turning some of that risky free time into safe and productive time spent learning.
