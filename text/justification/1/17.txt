They said that homework should be abolished in order to have more free time but education is more important. However, homework is more important than free time. The most important activity in life at this point is obtaining an education. Obtaining a successful education should always take priority over free time. Free time should be after homework has been completed. Furthermore during the week days free time should be especially limited so the pupil can put most of the focus on school work. The weekends should be utilized for free time. Homework should continue to be issued and completed.
