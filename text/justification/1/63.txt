They said that homework merely increases the gap between children who have support from a parent and those who have not. However, yes it might be true somehow. But it is not mutually exclusive in this debate. Those kind of gaps still remain without homework. Such kind of parent tend to be busy and it was deeply connected poverty. So, already their children have faced some obstacle. For example, children cannot go to private school or cram school to seek more suitable condition of education. Moreover, some of them need to help home care work like cooking, cleaning and so on. For such unprivileged children, homework is a precious opportunity to learn well. For this reason, I strongly believe that government point is not a matter.
