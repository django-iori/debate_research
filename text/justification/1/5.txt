They said that forcing kids to do homework instills passivity, so homework should be abolished. However, this argument assumes that homework is always forced on students and that students have no say in whether to do the work. In fact, students always have the choice to do the homework or face the consequences of failing to do their work. This teaches students an important lesson that applies to the real world: that choices have consequences. Homework is actually an ideal tool to teach this lesson, since students make the choice without the domineering presence of their teacher. Furthermore, homework assignments are not necessarily "forced" on students. Wise teachers know that homework is more appealing when it includes freedom and options, such as a choice between writing a book report or designing a book cover. In this way, homework is not passive work forced on the student, but work that requires the student to take charge and make choices.
