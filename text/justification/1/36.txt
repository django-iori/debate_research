They said that the death penalty is inhumane so we must strike it down. However, the prevailing method of execution in modern America is expressly designed to confer a painless death. By prefacing the lethal drug with a sedative, death by lethal injection more closely resembles an operation conducted under general anesthesia than a brutal state-sanctioned killing. As a society, we are constantly evolving. Just as technology such as DNA analysis has made wrongful conviction of the innocent unlikely, modern medicine allows the state to conduct painless executions. Likewise, just as we no longer rely on fallible eyewitness accounts when determining guilt, we no longer execute criminals by gibbeting or bludgeoning. In the future, one can imagine further improvements in swift, pain-free and mistake-free administration of the death penalty.
