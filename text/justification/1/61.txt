They said that we should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. However, it's so counterproductive. This is because they will lose many opportunities to learn it by abolishing homework. We believe that they can find it bad through being scold for such a bad behavior concerned with homework by their teachers and friends.
