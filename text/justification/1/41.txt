They said that the death penalty is causing the brutalization of modern society. However, there is no evidence or statistical data to suggest that modern society is any more brutal today than in the past, and that the cause of this brutality is the death penalty. It is true that there are instances where brutality occurs. Such instances may involve cases of domestic violence or mass shootings in public places. These cases are less common than the media portrays. Furthermore, there has been no evidence put forth that the occurrence of such incidents are the direct result of the death penalty. Domestic violence have a number of factors, as does mass shootings. These factors may include economic standing, mental health issues, or drug abuse. It would be incorrect to state that the death penalty increases the brutality of society because the act of killing someone is in itself brutal.
