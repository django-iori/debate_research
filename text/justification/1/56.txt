They said that evidently, modern society is becoming more and more brutal; parents killing their own children without any reasons; a son killing his own aging father; a desperate individual killing random people on the street. However, the modern society is more peaceful and educated than the past. In olden times, tribal mentality and gang wars were rife and people often took law into their own hands. Many crimes would go undetected. People didn't even understand the concept of reporting a crime. These days you have more awareness and due to tough law enforcement and newer technology, criminals are discouraged from breaking the law. The court system is also far more advanced with better resources than in the past.
