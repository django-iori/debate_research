They said that we should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. However, their ideal figure of study can not be achieved in their paradigm. They say that if there are homework it will lead wrong way to study. But if there no assignment, student will never study in the first place. As they illustrated, high school student have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So, they are free from obligation to do homework, it is natural not to do study by themselves. That is why their ideal study way never ever comes true in their paradigm.
