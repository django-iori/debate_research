They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character. However, yes it might be true somehow. But it is not mutually exclusive in this debate. Even if there are no assignments forced by teacher, children are forced many passive choices. For example, student parents say that “You should study harder than now , so you must go to cram school.” or ”you should play piano because it might be helpful for your future.”. These kind of parental oppression of child decision exit in their paradigm rather it will be stronger because parent need to instruct their child instead of the teacher. That’s why I believe government side point is not mutually exclusive.
