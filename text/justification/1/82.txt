They said that abolishing homework and teaching only in school is more efficient. However, they haven't explained why studying without homework is more efficient. We strongly believe that homework is an efficient way to pursue academic ability. In school, there are many students, and support from teachers tends to be insufficient. Moreover, there is time restriction and students cannot think at their own pace. They tend to be required to catch up with other students. On the other hand, studying at home has no time restrictions and they can research books or the internet about their question as much as they want. There is a lot of You-tube video that teaches you studying. It helps students with a good understanding of the class. And homework provides a good chance to study at home which is very helpful as I explained. Therefore, we should not abolish homework.
