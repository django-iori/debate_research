They said that because there is a chance of a mistake in a death penalty case, we must end capital punishment. However, this argument is a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Just because a tiny fraction of those executed may have been innocent doesn't mean the death penalty doesn't have more benefits than disadvantages. Instead of getting rid of the death penalty, we should be focused on eliminating the chance of error resulting in the execution of the truly innocent. One way this is already occurring is by increasingly relying on the strongest, most foolproof evidence: DNA left at the scene. Furthermore, video captured by security cameras is replacing eyewitness testimony, which has a greater chance of inaccuracy due to imperfect human memory. Another way mistakes can be reduced is by increasing use of all the legal avenues of redress, including the appeals process. Error reduction should be the focus rather than elimination of a penalty that protects society.
