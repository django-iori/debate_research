They said that homework prevents students from being able to think for themselves. However, homework, by its nature, actually requires students to work independently, more so than work done in the classroom. Once the assignment is given by the teacher, it is up to the student to do the work, which entails both preparation and execution. Having to do homework makes students less reliant on their teacher, because they have to figure out how to do the assignment, beyond the basic instructions and guidelines given by the teacher. In addition, teachers can -- and often do -- give creative homework assignments that require independent thinking and develop skills of research, insight and decision-making. Thus, homework is less of an obstacle to independent thinking than a tool that teaches it.
