They said that rehabilitation is a valid reason to adopt life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. However, rehabilitation fails in comparison with the death penalty at achieving what should be its primary objecting: reducing or eliminating repeat offending. While executing prisoners is completely effective in ensuring they never offend again, a life sentence can't give that guarantee. Even when the sentence is combined with the most carefully planned rehabilitation program, some prisoners will still commit crimes again, as long as they are alive. The reasons for this are complex, and include the very intertwined and often misunderstood roots of criminal behavior. But one thing is sure: capital punishment is an effective deterrent against future crimes committed by the involved criminal. Even if a life-sentenced prisoner never sees the light of day outside prison, he is still a threat to re-offend behind prison walls.
