They said that we cannot ensure fairness among children with homework. However, it's not true. This is because their analysis here is so doubtful. They tried to say that "when children face some difficulty on their homework, they have to rely on their parents." However, that assumption is not correct. If they hope, they can access to free education systems. For example, there are many NPOs which provide the free education. Even if their countries don't have it, they can ask teachers the questions. That's to say, parents are not only actor who can help their children. Such an unfair situation is minimized by free education systems. So we believe that their argument is not standing in this debate.
