They said that because it is an inhumane punishment, the death penalty must be abolished. However, rather than being merciless, the death penalty offers an escape from suffering for the criminal. In comparison to a life sentence, knowing that they will never again experience freedom, the death penalty must seem like a relief. When a criminal convicted of a capital offense is sentenced to life without parole, he will spend the rest of his years not only deprived of liberty. Worse, he must spend years contemplating what he has done, reliving his brutal acts, wracked with guilt if he possesses any conscience or humanity. In contrast, the death row inmate gets the benefit of spiritual guidance from a clergy member so he can repent of his sins and express remorse. This shows the relative humanity of the death sentence.
