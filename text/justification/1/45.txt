They said that life imprisonment is a better option than the death penalty because it involves rehabilitation. However, what is the point of rehabilitation if the intent is to keep someone locked up for life? Why spend a significant sum of money and use precious resources on training, counseling and reshaping the behavior of criminals who are never going to rejoin society anyway? Rehabilitation is more suitable for low-level crimes against property that carry relatively light sentences than for the kind of violent crimes against innocent citizens that would incur a death sentence -- or a life sentence, for that matter. A better use of that money and resources is to spend them in the community, in youth programs that target at risk youngsters who find an outlet in crime, instead of wasting them on unrepentant, hardened criminals.
