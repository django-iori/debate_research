They said that we should try to rehabilitate even those who randomly kill many people. However, unfortunately, some people are probably beyond rehabilitation. Logically, the people most resistant to genuine rehabilitation are also probably the same people who commit heinous capital crimes, such as mass murderers and terrorists. Some of these people are true psychopaths or sociopaths who may be able to mimic "normal" behavior, and pretend that they are rehabilitated, just long enough to get released back into society. However, once they no longer have a motive to feign remorse and repentance, there is a real risk they will return to criminal behavior and perhaps even escalate their crimes, since they escaped the death penalty once. This is the type of scenario that capital punishment avoids. So, if keeping society safe from the most dangerous criminals is your goal, rehabilitation doesn't really fit as the strategy.
