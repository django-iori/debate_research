They said that homework should be abolished. However, abolishing homework might seem like a great thing from the outset. Who is this going to be more beneficial to? That’s something that is hard for me to pinpoint. I’m leaning that it’s better for the lazy and unmotivated student. They did not want to do homework anyways. Their main reason was not being pressed for time either. It was all about not wanting to put forth the effort. The students that are pressed for time with extracurricular activities will not benefit as much as you think. They will find other things to take up their time. Perhaps it will be some other club. So I’m the end, you’re not rewarding students with more time to concentrate or better studying behavior. It’s going to give bad students a break and not really change much with the good students.
