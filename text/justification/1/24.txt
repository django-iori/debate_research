They said that homework lose to students character. However, it's not true. Because, homework is not always lose students character. In opposite, Some homework is done on an individual basis by individual students, so that each student can be identified on an individual basis. As a result, the individuality of the student is not lost. Also, this case is we can see students characters from homework. This is very good for students. On this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.
