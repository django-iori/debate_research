They said that when students copy homework from their classmates, they learn nothing. However, while I'm not going to argue that copying another student's homework is the right thing to do, it's inaccurate to say that there is no opportunity for learning in this situation. In fact, students can learn a lot from the act of copying another person's work. The lessons are not just academic and applicable only to school, moreover, since they apply to how one lives life in general. When a student copies a classmate's homework, he faces several consequences, ranging from having a guilty conscience to getting caught and getting punished or getting a failing grade because the original work that was copied was not up to par. By suffering these consequences, a student learns valuable life lessons about the importance of making the right choices.
