They said that we should do away with homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. However, the fact is, the kind of studying that works for one student or that works in one situation isn't necessarily right -- or wrong -- for another student or for another situation. Through trial and error, students learn the kind of studying that works for them. Homework is a great tool for this, since it is practiced frequently and since it has consequences that are both direct -- such as a passing grade -- and indirect -- such as succeeding at learning the material and applying it later on. Assigning homework regularly gives students many opportunities to figure out what kind of studying works best for them, whether that means practicing spelling words while showering and getting ready for school or skipping TV watching to devote full attention to writing a book report.
