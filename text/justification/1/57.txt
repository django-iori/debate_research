They said that because society creates criminals, it has a responsibility to them, and the death penalty is irresponsible. However, placing all the blame for criminal behavior on society is naive and fails to take into consideration the many diverse causes of crime. There are many risk factors for criminal behavior, and they are present in varied combinations in offenders. Some of these factors are more related to brain chemistry and other psychological issues than to societal pressures and circumstances. Other factors are engrained in society, including socio-economic disadvantages and the collapse of family structures. However, while we can feel smug about pointing the finger of blame at society, we shouldn't ignore the fact that criminals exercise free will when they choose to violate society's laws. Thus, saying society is responsible for rehabilitating rather than executing criminals because it made them is a flawed argument.
