They said that because the death penalty involves one person killing another, it is too inhumane. However, the role of the executioner isn't to inflict pain on the condemned prisoner. It is not even the executioner's decision to end the life of the death row prisoner. This decision is more accurately in the hands of the jury. Every execution is also the result of a choice made by a criminal. Imposing the death penalty is also the choice of society as a whole, which has historically supported this ultimate punishment, based on opinion polls. It is part of our justice system, and has been upheld by the Supreme Court, despite claims that the death penalty violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Thus, executions don't involve "one person killing another". They represent the carrying out of a sentence enacted to protect society.
