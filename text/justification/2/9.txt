They said that responsibility of schools. However, it's not true. Because, doing homework, on the other hand, can make the school's responsibilities less onerous. Because doing homework can measure the overall academic performance of the school and other things. However, if you abolish it, it becomes very difficult to do it, and schools should keep homework because they feel responsible for it. From this case, taking homework is essentially need for students. On this reason I think Homework shouldn't be abolish.
