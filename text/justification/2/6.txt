They said that the death penalty should be abolished due to executioner stress. However, there is no actual evidence presented that the executioner feels "overwhelming" stress after an execution as stated in the argument. In fact, the given argument argues against this, by pointing out that with some executions there is more than one executioner, so the guilt can not be linked to one individual. It only takes 1 person to volunteer to do the job, and I am sure that if you survey society you will find a por-death penalty person willing to do it and not feel stressed about it.
