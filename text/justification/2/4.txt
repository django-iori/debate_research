They said that the death penalty is harmful to the people that do the deed of pulling the switch or in the case of the  stated argument the persons  pushing the button that hangs the condemned man. However, there are now sophisticated computers that can take the place of the executioner therefore relieving the stress of being the person that actually pushes the button or pulls the lever. The computer can be programed from a different location for the time the execution is taking place. The person who programs the computer need not know the reason for the program and never feels the stress of killing another human being. The disassociation to the deed will then not cause the executioner any stress or guilt feelings. Computers have no feelings and only do what they are programmed to do. No human ever need to feel the stress of killing another human.
