They said that students should study like one-year-old baby. However, it is not relevant in this debate because students who are put on homework are not one year old. They already know many things compared to babies. The reason why babies can be positive to learn is that they do not know most things. Thus, babies are totally different types of people on the point of learning. Therefore, even if homework is abolished, students have little potential to study like one year old babies. So, to abolish homework is not effective in order to develop positive attitude for study.
