They said that in high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it?. However, I understand the burden of trying to fit in hobbies, club activities, jobs, normal school-work, and homework on top of that. However, this is a case of time management. While there are teachers that assign too much or too little homework - this will prepare you for the real world. There are going to be times in your full time job in the future where your boss gives you very little to do and it will be easy to manage. However, there will be times where you have projects come up last minute - ones you need to put many extra hours into. You will be dealing with things like a marriage, a house, kids, etc. If you learn how to manage your time in high school and these extra projects, it's going to prepare you for the real world.
