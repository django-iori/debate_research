They said that the brutality of the death penalty itself causes increasing brutality in modern society, such as the murder of children by their parents. However, the death penalty stands as a shield against barbaric crimes rather than a tool of barbarism. Imposition of the death penalty is handled in a civilized manner, and the prisoner is given every opportunity to prove his innocence, including the automatic right of appeal. Only a unanimous jury of peers can hand down such a sentence after weighing the strongest evidence, so the death penalty represents a just and sound act, not a barbaric or random one. Furthermore, whether by lethal injection or other method, the modern death penalty is imposed in a manner that is intended to be final but not painful. Instead of brutalizing society, this ultimate punishment serves as a strong message that our society does not permit brutality against innocents.
